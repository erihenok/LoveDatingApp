# Final project
For this individual project am planning to build a mobile dating app which I will name it a Love App. Dating application helps people to meet each other. Most of dating app are human computer interactions which is people can upload their personal information and pictures in their account at the same time people can talk, chat and exchanged information and data. Beside that the user can loaded their picture and they also can take a picture and videos. In order to use the Love App user must be sign up first and then sign in. once they sign up and sign in, they can fill the user details information such as name, address, phone number and location. You can choose the matches and if you do not like you can swipe to the next one. To build this app am gone use a swift language and a parse server which is Heroku to store a data.
